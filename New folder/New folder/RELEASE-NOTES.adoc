=== CycloneDX Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

This is _the first Log4j release_ that provides a {cyclonedx-sbom-link} along with each artifact.
Generated SBOMs are attached as artifacts with `cyclonedx` classifier and XML extensions, that is, `<artifactId>-<version>-cyclonedx.xml`.
They contain `vulnerability-assertion` references to a {cyclonedx-vdr-link} that Apache Logging Services uses for all projects it maintains.
This VDR is accessible through the following URL: https://logging.apache.org/cyclonedx/vdr.xml[]

SBOM generation is streamlined by `logging-parent`, see https://logging.apache.org/logging-parent/latest/#cyclonedx-sbom[its website] for details.
